What I want in this website clone of the Lindon pool website. I don't like how it looks and works so I'm going to make a copy.
	What I want to add that I did't see originaly.
		With the park info page add a map linked in so you can find it easer and next to it a calender with the days they are open, days they are closed and specal events with details.
		Have the website be more readable
		Have the website be prettier and aquadic themed
		Mabye link some videos
		Have a login mabye
		have the dropdown tabs fade in and out
